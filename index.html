                    "Bill is by far the most enthusiastic, passionate, and genuinely curious engineers I have ever worked with. His desire for continuous learning and personal skill development is only matched by his desire to teach, mentor, and up-level others around him. His enthusiasm is infectious and he promotes a culture of continuous growth, knowledge sharing, and improvement. He has been, and continues to be, a great role model for me and everyone he works with. I look forward to crossing paths with Cap10Bill again."

                    "He's one of the most talented engineers I've ever met, on all fronts, he was amazing as an architect, documenter, technical leader, project manager, people motivator, mentor.
                    One of his main skills is that he always thinks outside the box, leading to creative solutions to all problems, I really enjoyed working with Bill and I always appreciated his positive attitude at all times. Any company would be lucky to have him."

                    "A great guy to know at VMware if you supported vROps like I did. He always took extra time (even late at night) with me to explain things so that I could better understand them which translated to a better experience for my customers. I learned a lot from him not just the technical side, but also how he worked with the larger customers. What he taught me allowed me to become a better technical expert and a better resource for my customers. "

                    "We were building out our vRealize Operations (formally Integrien Alive, then VMware vCOPS) application infrastructure. This was at the time one of the most robust implementations on the planet. Bill was our go to guy when we met challenges during the build. Bill is extremely talented on all fronts, technical, leadership, project management, etc. Simply put, he is one of the most talented guys I have ever met. Moreover it was truly a joy to work with him."
