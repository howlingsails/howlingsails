<section id="core-playbook" class="highlight-box">
    <h2>Comprehensive Career &amp; Tech Launch Playbook</h2>
    <p>Below is a step-by-step framework to help you develop clarity in your goals, research relevant skills, and maintain a structured approach to career growth. Adapt these steps to your industry and personal objectives.</p>

    <h3>Define Your Career Timeline &amp; Goals</h3>
    <p>Chart your course with clear, actionable goals:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1-Year Goal:</strong> Secure an immediate or entry-level position.</li>
        <li><strong>3-Year Goal:</strong> Advance to a mid-level role with greater responsibilities.</li>
        <li><strong>5-Year Goal:</strong> Transition into a specialized or senior role, possibly leading projects or teams.</li>
        <li><strong>10-Year Goal:</strong> Aim for a high-level or executive position, establishing expertise in your field.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Pro Tip:</em> Log each milestone with potential job titles and brief descriptions that inspire you.</p>

    <h3>LinkedIn Research &amp; Skill Mapping</h3>
    <p>Use LinkedIn’s search features to study professionals in your target roles. Look at their skills, experiences, and career trajectories. Document your findings in a logbook or spreadsheet:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Examine both soft and hard skills (e.g., leadership, coding, specific tools).</li>
        <li>Note any common software or methodologies mentioned in their profiles.</li>
        <li>Identify potential gaps in your own skill set.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Compile &amp; Prioritize Your Master Skill List</h3>
    <p>Create a simple table or spreadsheet with columns for skill name, category, target timeline (1, 3, 5, or 10 years), frequency of appearance, and notes/examples. This helps you see which skills are critical now versus later.</p>

    <h3>Stack Job Openings &amp; Expand Horizons</h3>
    <p>Don’t limit yourself to a single job application at a time. Build a pipeline of potential openings, ranging from ones you can fulfill immediately to stretch roles a bit beyond your current scope. Proactively reach out to recruiters, even in distant markets.</p>

    <h3>Develop a 90-Day Skill &amp; Networking Plan</h3>
    <p>Devote a fixed amount of time each week (e.g., 4 hours) to learning a targeted skill. Resources might include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Online courses (Coursera, edX, Udemy)</li>
        <li>Webinars or local workshops</li>
        <li>Practice projects and mini-challenges</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Record your progress in a daily or weekly log, noting breakthroughs and obstacles. Revisit your plan every few weeks to make adjustments. During this period, actively network—send short messages to new contacts, follow up on prior discussions, and gather feedback on your growth.</p>

    <h3>Integrate Regulatory Compliance</h3>
    <p>Each industry has its own regulations—GDPR, HIPAA, ISO standards, or others. Document these requirements in your log, noting what they mean for your role. Seek relevant certifications or training to remain fully compliant.</p>

    <h3>Confirming the Right Direction</h3>
    <p>Every 90 days or so, pause and assess. Review your logbook, gather peer or mentor feedback, and see if your trajectory aligns with your values and career goals. If new opportunities or changing market conditions arise, update your plan accordingly.</p>
