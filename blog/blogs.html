    <h2>What Is Logbooking?</h2>
    <p>
        Logbooking is the art of documenting your every move while you learn and master new skills.
        Think of it as your personal treasure map—each entry reveals where you've been,
        what treasures you’ve unearthed, and how you overcame lurking sea monsters (a.k.a. pesky bugs and errors).
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether you're grappling with new commands or sailing into uncharted coding waters,
        jotting down your experiences can help you stay afloat.
        By reflecting on challenges and breakthroughs, you’ll chart a clearer course toward skill mastery—and help
        your future self navigate those same waters with confidence.
